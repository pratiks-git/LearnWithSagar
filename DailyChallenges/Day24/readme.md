# Day24 Challenge: Pod Mastery: Securing, Scaling, and Managing Kubernetes Pods

Hello Learners,


Welcome back to another thrilling episode of the DevOps SRE Daily Challenge! 

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ Weâ€™ve already covered 25% of the CKA syllabus in just 6 days. This CKA Series is part of the larger Daily DevOps/SRE Challenge Series, a journey spanning 365 days of continuous learning and challenges. </br></br>Today marks Day 24 overall in the series and Day 7 specifically for the CKA challenges.
Starting from today, we dive into the second section of the CKA syllabus: Workloads and Scheduling, where you'll begin to understand how Kubernetes manages Pods, resource allocation, and workload execution effectively.</br></br>Today, we're focusing on Kubernetes Pods - your application's most basic and fundamental unit of deployment. We're going to walk through the creation, configuration, and securing of Pods, while also integrating them with security mechanisms like Service Accounts, RBAC, and Network Policies.

# Understanding Kubernetes Pods
## What is a Pod?
- A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
- It encapsulates one or more containers (e.g., Docker containers), storage resources, and network configurations.
- Pods are designed to host tightly coupled application containers that need to share resources, such as:
  - Network: Containers in a Pod share the same IP address and port space.
  - Storage: They can share volumes for persistent or ephemeral storage.

## Pod Lifecycle
Pods are ephemeral by design. If a Pod dies, Kubernetes creates a new Pod (with a new IP) as part of a higher-level construct, like a Deployment or ReplicaSet.

## Pod Networking
### How Pods Get IPs
  - Each Pod is assigned a unique IP address by the Kubernetes network plugin (CNI, e.g., Calico, Flannel).
  - All containers in the Pod share this IP, allowing them to communicate with each other using localhost.
  - Pods communicate with other Pods or services through this IP or via DNS provided by Kubernetes.
###  Networking Within a Pod
  - Containers communicate using localhost and specific ports.
  - A shared network namespace ensures that all containers in the same Pod can access the same network interfaces and ports.
### Networking Across Pods
  - Pods in different namespaces or clusters communicate using service DNS names or Pod IPs.
  - Network policies can restrict or allow communication between Pods based on labels, namespaces, or IP ranges.
### Networking Across Namespaces
  - Namespaces isolate resources, including Pods, Services, and ConfigMaps.
  - Pods in different namespaces need explicit DNS names (e.g., pod-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local) for communication.
    
## Pod Storage
###  Volume Sharing
  - Containers in a Pod can share storage volumes mounted at specified paths.
  - Volumes persist data between container restarts within the Pod.
### Ephemeral vs. Persistent Volumes
  - Ephemeral: Data exists only as long as the Pod is alive (e.g., emptyDir).
  - Persistent: Data persists even after the Pod is deleted (e.g., PersistentVolume).

## Pods and Namespaces
### Default Namespace
  - If not specified, Pods are created in the default namespace.
### Custom Namespaces
  - Namespaces provide logical separation of resources.
  - Pods in one namespace cannot directly access resources in another namespace unless allowed by network policies or RBAC.
### Pod DNS Naming
  - Pods in the same namespace can be addressed by their name.
  -  Pods in different namespaces use pod-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local.

## Sharing Resources in a Pod
### Shared Network
  - All containers share the same network namespace, allowing easy communication without exposing ports externally.
### Shared Storage
  - Volumes enable containers to share data.
  - Use cases include:
    1. Logs shared between containers.
    2. Temporary data passed between containers.
### CPU and Memory

Resource limits can be set for containers, but they still belong to the same cgroup.

## How Pods Fit into Kubernetes
### Workloads:
  - Pods are managed by controllers like Deployments, StatefulSets, or DaemonSets for replication and self-healing.
###  Ephemeral Nature
  - Pods are not designed to be durable. Use PersistentVolumes or StatefulSets for stateful applications.


Here's a basic YAML file for a Kubernetes Pod, along with explanations for each line:
```
apiVersion: v1                     # Specifies the API version for the resource. 'v1' is for core Kubernetes resources like Pods.
kind: Pod                          # Specifies the type of resource being created. Here, it's a Pod.
metadata:                          # Metadata contains information about the Pod.
  name: my-pod                     # The name of the Pod, must be unique within the namespace.
  namespace: default               # (Optional) Specifies the namespace where the Pod will reside. Default is 'default' if not specified.
  labels:                          # Key-value pairs to categorize the Pod.
    app: my-app                    # A label to identify the application this Pod belongs to.

  - name: my-container             # The name of the container within the Pod.
    image: nginx:latest            # Specifies the container image to use. Here, it's 'nginx' with the 'latest' tag.
    ports:                         # Defines the ports the container will expose.
    - containerPort: 80            # Specifies that the container listens on port 80.
    resources:                     # Specifies resource requests and limits for the container.
      requests:                    # Minimum resources the container requires.
        cpu: "100m"                # 100 milliCPU (0.1 CPU core).
        memory: "128Mi"            # 128 MiB of memory.
      limits:                      # Maximum resources the container can use.
        cpu: "250m"                # 250 milliCPU (0.25 CPU core).
        memory: "256Mi"            # 256 MiB of memory.
    volumeMounts:                  # Specifies how volumes are mounted into the container.
    - name: shared-data            # The name of the volume to mount.
      mountPath: /data             # Path inside the container where the volume will be mounted.
  volumes:                         # Defines the volumes available to the Pod.
  - name: shared-data              # Volume name.
    emptyDir: {}                   # A temporary directory that shares data between containers in the Pod.

  - Why is it important to define resource limits for your Pods?

# The practical challenge:
## Step 1: Pod Basics
- Read about the Pod definition, lifecycle, and uses from the documentation.
- Create a Pod named basic-pod running nginx using:
### Imperative method (Using command):
 ```kubectl run basic-pod --image=nginx --restart=Never```

### Declarative method (YAML manifest):
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: basic-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

## Step 2. Multi-Container Pods
- Understand the concept of multi-container Pods and how they share networking and storage.
- Create a Pod named multi-pod with:
  - nginx container exposing port 80.
  - busybox container running sleep 3600.
  - Use a shared emptyDir volume to exchange data between containers.

### Imperative Approach:
``` kubectl run ecommerce-pod --image=nginx --restart=Never --port=80 ```

</br><b>Note:</b> Add second container by editing the pod yaml file and applying the changes

### Declarative Approach:

Create the following YAML file ecommerce-pod.yaml:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: ecommerce-pod
labels:
   app: nginx
run: busybox
spec:
containers:
- name: nginx
image: nginx
ports:
- containerPort: 80
- name: busybox
image: busybox
command: ["sleep", "3600"]
```     

### Deploy the Pod
Run the following command to deploy the pod:
``` kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml ```

### Verify the Pod Status
``` kubectl get pods ```

### Describe the Pod
``` kubectl describe pod ecommerce-pod ```

### Access the Pod Logs
View the logs of the NGINX Pod to ensure itâ€™s running correctly:
``` kubectl logs ecommerce-pod ```


## Step 3. Add Init Containers
### Add an init container to ensure the nginx container starts only after necessary dependencies are initialized.
YAML Update:
```
initContainers:
- name: init-busybox
  image: busybox
  command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Initializing frontend; sleep 5"]
```

## Step 4. Secure the Pod
### Add securityContext features to the Pod:
  - Ensure all containers run as non-root users.
  - Drop unnecessary Linux capabilities.
YAML Update:
```
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 1000
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        drop:
        - ALL
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        drop:
        - ALL
```

### Securing Pods with Service Accounts
Pods can inherit permissions through Service Accounts. Letâ€™s secure the Pod by using a Service Account for access management.

### Create a Service Account
Define the service account in your YAML file:
```
apiVersion: v1  
kind: ServiceAccount  
metadata:  
  name: nginx-sa
```

### Bind the Service Account to the Pod
Update the Pod definition to use the created Service Account:

```
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Pod  
metadata:  
  name: nginx-pod  
spec:  
  serviceAccountName: nginx-sa  
  containers:  
    - name: nginx  
      image: nginx:latest  
      ports:  
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Deploy the Pod with the Service Account
Re-deploy the Pod with the new configuration:
``` kubectl apply -f nginx-pod-sa.yaml  ```

### Verify the Service Account Binding
Run the following to check if the Service Account is properly assigned:
``` kubectl get pod nginx-pod -o=jsonpath='{.spec.serviceAccountName}'  ```

### Implementing RBAC for Pod Access
Control who can access the resources in your Pods using Kubernetes RBAC. In this task, youâ€™ll configure RBAC to allow only authorized users to access the Pod.

Define a Role
Create a Role in a specific namespace (e.g., default) that allows reading Pod details:
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1  
kind: Role  
metadata:  
  namespace: default  
  name: pod-reader  
rules:  
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

Bind the Role to a User or Service Account
Define a RoleBinding to associate the user/service account with the Role:
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1  
kind: RoleBinding  
metadata:  
  name: pod-reader-binding  
  namespace: default  
subjects:  
- kind: ServiceAccount  
  name: nginx-sa  
  namespace: default  
roleRef:  
  kind: Role  
  name: pod-reader  
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Apply the Role and RoleBinding
Run the following commands to apply the configurations:
```
kubectl apply -f role.yaml  
kubectl apply -f rolebinding.yaml  
```

Step 5. Configure Resource Limits
Configure resource requests and limits for the containers:
nginx: Request 100m CPU and 128Mi memory; Limit 250m CPU and 256Mi memory.
busybox: Request 50m CPU and 64Mi memory; Limit 100m CPU and 128Mi memory.
YAML Update:
```
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
  limits:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
```

## Step 6. Implement Probes
Add liveness and readiness probes for the nginx container:
Liveness probe: HTTP GET /healthz on port 80.
Readiness probe: TCP check on port 80.
YAML Update:
```
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 80
  initialDelaySeconds: 3
  periodSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  tcpSocket:
    port: 80
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
```

## Step 7. Static Pod Implementation
### Deploy the same Pod as a static Pod by placing the YAML file in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/.
Steps:
- Copy the YAML file to the directory:
  - sudo cp ecommerce-pod.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
- Verify the kubelet automatically creates the Pod:
``` kubectl get pods```

## Step 8. Enable or control Networking
- Deploy a second Pod named backend running busybox.
- Verify communication between ecommerce-pod and backend using DNS.
Steps:

Create the backend Pod:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    command: ["sleep", "3600"]
```

Test communication:
```kubectl exec ecommerce-pod -- ping backend```


Now limit the communication between Pods to ensure that only authorized Pods can communicate with each other.

Create a Network Policy
Define a simple Network Policy that allows only Pods with a specific label to communicate with your Pod:
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1  
kind: NetworkPolicy  
metadata:  
  name: allow-nginx  
spec:  
  podSelector:  
    matchLabels:  
      app: nginx  
  ingress:  
  - from:  
    - podSelector:  
        matchLabels:  
          app: nginx
```

Apply the Network Policy
Apply the policy using:

```kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml  ```
Test Communication Between Pods
Deploy another Pod (e.g., curl-pod) in the same namespace and test if it can access the ecommerce Pod.

```kubectl run curl-pod --rm -it --image=curlimages/curl -- /bin/sh  
curl ecommerce-pod:80  
```

## Step 9. Test Pod Behavior
- Simulate a resource conflict by deploying the Pod on a node with limited resources.
- Deploy pod with the same name in same and different namespaces
- Test the liveness and readiness probes by making /healthz unavailable temporarily.
