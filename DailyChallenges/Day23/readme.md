# Day23 Challenge: Securing Santa's Workshop: Mastering Kubernetes RBAC and AWS IAM Integration


Hello Learners,



Welcome back to another thrilling episode of the DevOps SRE Daily Challenge! ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ…

In the spirit of the holiday season, todayâ€™s challenge focuses on securing your Kubernetes clusters with a Christmas and Santa Claus theme. We will explore the integration of AWS IAM with **Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and the management of users and groups created using OpenSSL.

Your mission? To ensure that Santa's workshop is secure, allowing only the right elves (users) to access the resources they need while keeping out any naughty ones!


## What You'll Learn:
- How to create and manage Kubernetes RBAC for users and groups created with OpenSSL.
- How to integrate AWS IAM users and roles with Kubernetes RBAC in an Amazon EKS cluster.
- How to utilize Kubernetes service accounts for applications running in pods.
- Best practices for managing access permissions securely in your Kubernetes environment.

## Challenge Tasks:
### The RBAC and IAM Theory Challenge:
Before we dive into practical tasks, letâ€™s set the scene:
**What is Kubernetes RBAC?**
- Define RBAC and explain its role in managing access to Kubernetes resources.
- Discuss why integrating AWS IAM with Kubernetes RBAC is crucial for securing access during the holiday rush.

**Understanding AWS IAM Integration:**
- Explain how AWS IAM roles and users interact with Kubernetes RBAC.
- Describe the purpose of the aws-auth ConfigMap in mapping IAM identities to Kubernetes roles.

**Key Components of RBAC:**
- What are Roles and ClusterRoles in the context of Santaâ€™s workshop?
- Explain the difference between RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindingsâ€”who gets what access?

**Service Accounts:**
- What are service accounts, and how do they differ from user accounts?
- Explain how service accounts can be used to manage permissions for applications running in pods.

**Best Practices for Securing Santa's Workshop:**
- List essential best practices for managing RBAC effectively while integrating with AWS IAM.
- Discuss the importance of regularly reviewing permissions to prevent unauthorized access by mischievous elves.

### Implementing RBAC with OpenSSL Users, AWS IAM, and Service Accounts

Time to roll up your sleeves and secure Santa's operations!
### Task 1: Grant Access to Users and Groups Created with OpenSSL
###### Setup: Use a Kubernetes cluster deployed via Kubeadm or an EKS cluster for this task.
**Create a User:**
Use OpenSSL to generate a certificate for the user.
```
openssl genrsa -out user.key 2048
openssl req -new -key user.key -out user.csr -subj "/CN=user"
openssl x509 -req -in user.csr -signkey user.key -out user.crt
```

Create a Group:

Similarly, create a certificate for the group.
```
openssl genrsa -out group.key 2048
openssl req -new -key group.key -out group.csr -subj "/CN=group"
openssl genrsa -out group.key 2048
openssl req -new -key group.key -out group.csr -subj "/CN=group"
openssl x509 -req -in group.csr -signkey group.key -out group.crtopenssl x509 -req -in group.csr -signkey group.key -out group.crt
```

**Create a Role:**
Define a Role that grants specific permissions within a namespace (e.g., development).
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: development
  name: developer-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "create"]
```
  
  
  
**Create RoleBindings:**
Bind the Role to the user and the group.
**RoleBinding for User:**
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: user-role-binding
  namespace: development
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: user  # Replace with actual username from certificate CN
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: developer-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
  
**RoleBinding for Group:**
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: group-role-binding
  namespace: development
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: group  # Replace with actual group name from certificate CN
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: developer-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
 ``` 
  
**Apply the Configurations:**
```
kubectl apply -f role.yaml
kubectl apply -f user-role-binding.yaml
kubectl apply -f group-role-binding.yaml
```

### Task 2: Grant Access to IAM Users and Roles in EKS
1. Setup:
   - Continue using the same EKS cluster.
   - Create an IAM User in AWS Management Console or CLI.

2. Update aws-auth ConfigMap:
  - Edit the aws-auth ConfigMap to map the IAM user to a Kubernetes user.
``` kubectl edit configmap aws-auth -n kube-system```

  - Add entries under mapUsers:
```
mapUsers: |
  - userarn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/santa-helper 
    username: santa-helper 
    groups:
      - system:masters
```
3. Create an IAM Role that can be assumed by EC2 instances.
4. Update aws-auth ConfigMap for IAM Role:
    - Add entries under mapRoles in the aws-auth ConfigMap:
```
mapRoles: |
  - rolearn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/santa-ec2-role 
    username: santa-ec2-user 
    groups:
      - system:nodes
```

5. Create ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding (if needed):
    - Define ClusterRoles and bind them to the IAM users or roles if they need access across namespaces.
Create a ClusterRole:
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole 
metadata:
  name: deployment-viewer 
rules:
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["deployments"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

Create ClusterRoleBinding:
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding 
metadata:
  name: deployment-viewer-binding 
subjects:
- kind: User 
  name: santa-helper  
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole 
  name: deployment-viewer
```
 
Apply the Configurations:
```
kubectl apply -f clusterrole.yaml 
kubectl apply -f clusterrolebinding.yaml
```

Task 3: Utilize Service Accounts in Your Applications
Create a Service Account for an application running in your cluster (e.g., an application that needs access to pods).

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: app-sa 
  namespace: development
```

Bind Permissions to Service Account using a Role or ClusterRole.
```
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding 
metadata:
  name: app-sa-binding 
  namespace: development 
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount 
  name: app-sa  
roleRef:
  kind: Role 
  name: developer-role
```

Apply the Service Account Configuration:
```
kubectl apply -f serviceaccount.yaml 
kubectl apply -f app-sa-binding.yaml 
```

### Task 4: Deploy Applications and Validate Access
1. Deploy an Application Using Service Account:
Deploy a simple application that uses the service account created earlier.
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example-app-deployment 
spec:
  replicas: 1 
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-app 
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example-app 
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: app-sa  
      containers:
      - name: example-app-container  
        image: nginx  
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Apply this deployment configuration.
```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml  
```
 
2. Validate Access Using kubectl auth can-i:
You can use kubectl auth can-i commands to validate whether specific actions are allowed for different users, groups, or service accounts.
Check if santa-helper can list pods in development namespace as follows: ``` kubectl auth can-i list pods --as=santa-helper --namespace=development  ```
Check if user can create pods: ``` kubectl auth can-i create pods --as=user --namespace=development  ```
Check if app-sa (service account) can get pods: ``` kubectl auth can-i get pods --as=system:addserviceaccount --namespace=development  
Check Application Logs (for debugging):
You can check logs of your application pod to ensure it is running correctly:
``` kubectl logs <example-app-pod-name> --namespace=development   ```
